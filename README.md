The purpose of version 0.1 is to get example google graphs displayed by amber and to gain insight into what the requirements for the 1.0 release should be.

To Be Done
----------
Split the implmentation into GoogleCharts.st and GoogeChartExample.st where GoogleCharts is the reusable library and GoogleChartExample shows few examples.
Be prepaired to split the JSAPI.js ("the loading API") for use with other Google products.
Design smalltalk friendly api for generic charts.
